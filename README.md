# Face_Recognition
In this project I have used pretrained model Facenet to make face recognition model. I have also used MTCNN Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks to extract 
bounding faces from the images. Using Euclidean distance I was able to identify if the model is recognizing images correctly or not.
